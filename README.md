16-Bit Single-Cycle Processor

1. The final processor design file (.circ format) is 
COMP303_TermProject_Hasan_Can_ASLAN_Nursena_KÖPRÜCÜ2.circ

2. The Report containing a circuit schematic, table summarizing control 
signals, description of our design and custom instruction is in
16_Bit_Single_Cycle_Processor/project_report/COMP303_TermProject_Report.pdf

3. Test programs: instruction files are in,
16_Bit_Single_Cycle_Processor/test_program/test_program_code.txt,
data files are in,
16_Bit_Single_Cycle_Processor/test_program/test_program_data.txt
their assembly codes and trace in, 
16_Bit_Single_Cycle_Processor/test_program/test_program_asm.txt,

4. Trace of the test programs, demonstrating that correct result was 
obtained is also in the Project Report.
